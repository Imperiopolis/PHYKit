  UIViewController is a generic controller base class that manages a view.  It has methods that are called
  when a view appears or disappears.
 
  Subclasses can override -loadView to create their custom view hierarchy, or specify a nib name to be loaded
  automatically.  This class is also a good place for delegate & datasource methods, and other controller
